**Height Trait By Henry**

Source: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2707217128

I have made following fixes in the above mod:
1. Fixed an issue with Enormous trait where it was so extreme that it turned the characters into a Slender Man.
2. Removed the **Likelihood of dying in Battle** attribute from the Enormous trait.

Here are the features of this mod:
1. Adds seven different traits for character's height.
2. Allows player to use a one time decision to change their height.
3. Height traits will be distributed to all the characters at the start of the game.

## TODO
- Put Giant and Dwarf traits in line with the Height trait otherwise these two traits are not making any sense anymore. Typically a giant should be tallest and a dwarf should be the smallest.
- Remove Diminutive trait as the dwarf trait should suffice for that.
- Remove the Enormous trait and use those genes for the Giant trait. This will also make it a rare trait and not every third person would have it.

## FAQ

**Does this work with the existing save?**
Not at the moment. It somehow turns all characters into a dwarf if you load this in middle of a game. I will see if I can fix this as this exist in the original mod as well.

**Is this compatible with EPE?**
Yes. I use this with CFP, EPE and barbershop mod without any problem.

**What is the suggested load order?**
For now, you can put it wherever you want. It wouldn't make any difference. But this might change when I add more traits and stuff in this mod.
