## Traits

**Height Trait By Henry**

Source: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2707217128

I have made following fixes in the above mod:
1. Removed the Enormous Trait and tweaked Giant to be used for the same.
2. Fixed the Slender-Man Characters issue with Towering and Enormous/Giant Trait.
3. Removed the **Likelihood of dying in Battle** attribute from the Enormous/Giant trait.

Here are the features of this mod:
1. Adds six different traits for character's height and also tweaks the Giant attribute to make them tallest.
2. Allows player to use a one time decision to change their height.
3. Height traits will be distributed to all the characters at the start of the game.

## Incompatibility

This mod is incompatible with any mod that adds or modifies the height or Giant trait.

Please let me know about the other incompatible mods so I can either include them in this or create a patch for them.

## TODO
- Remove Diminutive trait as the dwarf trait should suffice for that.

## FAQ

**Does this work with the existing save?**
Not at the moment. It somehow turns all characters into a dwarf if you load this in middle of a game. I will see if I can fix this as this exist in the original mod as well.

**Is this compatible with EPE?**
Yes. I use this with CFP, EPE and barbershop mod without any problem.

**What is the suggested load order?**
For now, you can put it wherever you want. It wouldn't make any difference. But this might change when I add more traits and stuff in this mod.
