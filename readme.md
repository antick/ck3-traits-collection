**Height Trait By Henry**

Source: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2707217128

This mod was good but it's not being updated for a long time. And there are couple of issues with it. So I decided to make my own version of it.

I have made following fixes in the above mod:
1. Removed the Enormous Trait and tweaked Giant to be used for the same.
2. Removed Diminutive Trait and tweaked Dwarf to be used for the same.
3. Fixed the Slender-Man issue with Characters while using Towering and Enormous (Removed) Trait.
4. Removed the **Likelihood of dying in Battle** attribute from the Enormous (Removed) and Diminutive (Removed) trait.

Here are the few basic features of this mod:
1. Adds five different traits for character's height and also tweaks the Giant and Dwarf traits so they are sync with other height traits.
2. Allows player to use a one time decision to change their height when they start their game.
3. Height traits will be distributed to all the characters at the start of the game.

## Incompatibility

This mod is incompatible with any mod that adds or modifies the Giant Trait, Dwarf Trait and height genes.

Please let me know about the other incompatible mods that you encounter so I can either include them in this mod with a fix or create a patch for them.

## TODO
- Culture based height distribution.

## FAQ

**Does this work with the existing save?**
No. For some reason, it turns all characters into a dwarf if you load this in middle of a game. I will see if I can fix this somehow.

**Is this compatible with EPE?**
Yes. I use this with CFP, EPE and Barbershop without any problem.

**What is the suggested load order?**
For now, you can put it wherever you want. It wouldn't make any difference. But this might change when I add more traits and stuff in this mod.
