**Height Trait By Henry**

I have made following fixes in the above mod:
1. Fixed the issue where Enormous trait was too extreme and causing issues with the character's height and hands.
2. Removed the **Likelihood of dying in Battle** attribute from the Enormous trait.

Here are the features of this mod:
1. Adds seven different traits for character's height.
2. Allows player to use a one time decision to change their height.
3. Height traits will be distributed to all the characters at the start of the game.

## FAQ

**Does this work with the existing save?**
Not at the moment. It somehow turns all characters into a dwarf if you load this in middle of a game. I will see if I can fix this as this exist in the original mod as well.

**Is this compatible with EPE?**
Yes. I use this with CFP, EPE and barbershop mod without any problem.
